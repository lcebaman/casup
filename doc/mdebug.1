Debugging messages

.PP
Debugging messages start with
.CW DEBUG: .
.PP
Some routines provide a capability to print
debugging output on request.
For example, input argument
.CW debug
in routine 
.DS L
.CW
subroutine cgca_clvgp( coarray, rt, t, scrit, sub, periodicbc, iter,  &
                       heartbeat, debug )
.DE
is a logical variable.
If
.CW
debug = .true.
.R
then some debugging information will be dumpted to stdout
by that routine, and by all routines invoked by this routine,
if any of them provide debugging capability.
For example, routine
.CW cgca_clvgp
above calls routine
.CW cgca_clvgsd
which prints debug ouput when
.CW
debug = .true.
.R
is passed to cgca_clvgp:
.DS L
.CW
DEBUG: cgca_clvgsd: img: 6: newstate=-3, calling cgca_gcf, gcupd=(34 9 1),
marr=(9 9 27 9 27 27 9 27 27 9 9 27 9 34 34 34 34 34 9 34 34 34 34 34 34
 34 34 ).
DEBUG: cgca_clvgsd: img: 2: newstate=-4, calling cgca_gcf, gcupd=(27 34 1),
marr=(27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 34 27 27 9 9 9 34 34 34
 34 34 34 ).
.DE
Note that the long lines of debugging output have been wrapped here.
.PP
The volume of debugging output can be very large.
The user is advised to use caution when asking
for debugging output, particularly on large core counts.
In some cased debugging output can exceed several GB.
