CASUP design assumes that routines might need
to pass messages to the user.
There are four levels of user messages:
.IP 1.
information
.IP 2.
warning 
.IP 3.
error 
.IP 4.
debugging
.PP
Each message is written to stdout as a single line of text.
Some messages can be long, so they might wrap when
viewed in some editors.
The decision not to break a message into multiple
one-line chunks was taken to simplify searching for
messages, e.g. with
.CW grep .
Having a message written as a single line makes
searching for the complete message easier.
.PP
The first field in all messages is a label showing
the level of the message, followed by a colon,
.CW : ,
exactly one of:
.CW INFO: ,
.CW WARN: ,
.CW ERROR: or
.CW DEBUG: .
The standard labels are used to search for a particular
type of messages.
For example to check if there are any warnings issued
by the program the user can use this command:
.DS L
\fCgrep WARN \fP<\fIoutfile\fP>.
.DE
or
.DS L
\fCgrep "^WARN:" \fP<\fIoutfile\fP>
.DE
or to see all debugging output, the user can issue this
command:
.DS L
\fCgrep DEBUG: \fP<\fIoutfile\fP>
.DE
or
.DS L
\fCgrep "^DEBUG" \fP<\fIoutfile\fP>
.DE
.PP
The second field in all messages is the name of the
routine that issued that message, followed by a colon,
.CW : ,
e.g.
.CW cgca_clvgsd: ,
.CW cgca_nr: ,
etc.
.PP
Colons are used to help separate the messages into
fields, with tools such as
.CW awk .
.PP
The third field is the content of the message.
This field is not standardised and will
differ from one routine to another, hopefully
giving the user some helpful information.
.PP
Some messages will contain the number of
the image that issued the message.
.so minfo.1
.so mwarn.1
.so merr.1
.so mdebug.1
