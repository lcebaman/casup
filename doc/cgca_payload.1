.XN -N AAAS -- Derived type \fCcgca_lnklst_tpayload\fP
.PP
This is the type for payload, i.e. the data
contained in each node of the list.
.DS L
.CW
type cgca_lnklst_tpayld
  integer :: lwr(3), upr(3)
end type cgca_lnklst_tpayld
.DE
The intention is that the data consists of
the coordinates of the two corners of a CA box,
the lower and the upper.
The lower corner is that which has the lowest
coordinates along all 3 directions.
The upper corner is that which has the upper
coordinates along all 3 directions.
For example
.DS L
.CW
lwr = (/  1 , 200 ,    3 /)
upr = (/ 10 , 202 , 3000 /)
.DE
would denote a box extending from 1 to 10
along direction 1, from 200 to 202 along direction 2,
and from 3 to 3000 along direction 3.
