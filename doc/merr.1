Error messages start with
.CW ERROR: .
.PP
CASUP was designed to treat all
errors as fatal.
In fact all error conditions are implemented with
.CW ERROR
.CW STOP
Fortran 2008 intrinsic which initiates error
termination.
The program is expected to exit as soon as possible.
Therefore it is expected that there will not be
more than a single error message issued by any
CASUP program.
This means that searching for error messages might
not be needed.
.PP
Typical conditions resulting in the issuing of
error messages, e.g. in error termination, are
insufficient memory when
allocating arrays or conditions which violate
the model logic, e.g. passing non-existent
grain numbers or image numbers.
Examples:
.DS L
.CW
ERROR: cgca_dv: cannot deallocate coarray
ERROR: cgca_gc: coarray not allocated, img: 17
.DE
