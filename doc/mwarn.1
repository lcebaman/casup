Warning messages

Warning messages start with
.CW WARN: .
These messages are intended to warn the user
of unexpected input, undesirable settings,
unexpected, but not fatal, runtime conditions, etc.
Example:
.DS L
.CW
WARN: cgca_gcr: image 1144: No match found for given pair: 3904 2126.
WARN: cgca_nr: too many nuclei - no physical sense! nuclei/model size:  0.683E+06
.DE
The user generally does not have the control
over warning messages.
These are issued based on the logic of the
CASUP library.
It is up to the user what action to take
on encountering one of the warning messages.
Some warnings might safely be ignored.
Other warnings, such as the second warning above,
might indicate that the
results have no physical sense.
The user can then decide to terminate the analysis
early, change the input values and rerun.
Yet other warnings might indicate unexpected
conditions demanding further investigation,
e.g. the first warning above.
